    o   Updated NAMESPACE (for versions > 2.5).

    o	Some changes in help files.
    
    o	Cleaned Fortran source files (eliminated unused 
	subroutines and used the posted complier output to 
	straighten details). 

    o	Implemented more efficient transpose Fortran code.
        This also eliminates a bug when transposing a 1 row 
	matrix.

    o	Eliminated bug when assigning with a 1 row matix.

    o	Eliminated bug when plotting a 1 row matix.

    o	Minor R code cleaning.

    o   Updated NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION file.

    o	print and summary pass back NULL instead of the 
	object.

    o   Changed to prod(x@dimension) instead of nrow*ncol to 
	overcome integer overflow for very large matrices.

    o   Introduced a prototype in the definition of spam 
	and spam.chol.*.

    o   .Spam$safemode also determines if a spam object is 
	tested for validity, as well as for NAOK.

    o   In many functions sparse matrix construction is 
	done manually using slots (and check=FALSE, if 
	approprate).

    o	Increased the value of symmetry criteria to 
	(2+eps)*eps, as each element can be off by eps, 
	subtraction leads to a 2*eps offset and yet we are 
	symmetric.

    o   Major restructuration of chol/det with elimination
	of auxiliarychol. 

    o	Methods chol/backsolve/forwarsolve now call the *.spam
	functions.

    o 	Many internal changes to favour speed and efficiency.

    o 	Bug fix in .spam.elemul. occuring when the result is the 
	zero matrix.
